                <div class="paragraph">

                    <p>TechTogether, the nation's largest initiative to address the gender inequities in the hackathon community, supports over 10,000 hackers. TechTogether is credited with increasing the gender diversity of the hackathon community by 18% from 2019 to 2020.</p>

                    <p>Since we were founded in 2017, TechTogether has served over 3,500 people of marginalized genders through our annual gender-focused hackathons hosted across the country. On average, 50% of our hackers have never attended a hackathon before.</p> 

                    <p>TechTogether's Chapter Program is for individuals interested in helping to host a TechTogether hackathon in their city. The program is a guided experience where you get to learn how to host a gender-focused hackathon with the guidance of the TechTogether leadership team. TechTogether has been hosting hackathons for 4 years with an average 99% recommendation rating. All hackathons for the 2021-2022 hackathon season will be virtual.</p>

                </h1>

                <div class="paragraph">

                    <p>This year, TechTogether revamped our applicant guidelines. Applicants must be between the ages of 16-24 enrolled in either high school, college, a bootcamp, or training program. If you do not fall in this group, we encourage you to email us for other ways to get <a href="/volunteer">involved with TechTogether</a>. All former organizers must reinterview each year. We encourage individuals of all genders and backgrounds to apply.</p>

                    <p>All organizers must reside (or go to school) in the state in which the chapter is located. For example, if you live in Washington state you can apply to join the Seatte chapter.</p>

                    <p>Applicants ideally have 5-10 hours a week to dedicate to their role. We understand that this may not be possible every week, so consider this a guideline and not a mandate. Directors should budget for a more intensive time commitment.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">

                    <p>TechTogether recruits the Chapter Directors first. Each applicant that makes it to the interview round will have to through 2-3 interviews with the TechTogether leadership team.</p>

                    <p>After the Chapter Directors are selected, we will open applications for the Team Lead and General Member roles. Each applicant that makes it to the interview round will have to through 2-3 interviews with the TechTogether leadership team and Chapter Director.</p>
