                    <p>The goal of our first research project is to collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data to understand how level of participation in collegiate hackathons, particularly gender-focused hackathons, affects women, femme, and non-binary identifying participantsâ€™ attitudes towards computing majors. </p>

                    <p>This is TechTogether's first research project and will be conducted be our Research Fellows, Katrina Vergara and Radhika Gulati.</p>
