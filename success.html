                    <p>"My greatest take away from this hackathon is that nothing is impossible. When I first came into HobbyHacks, I felt like I could never learn python and that creating a business was unfathomable. However, after attending this hackathon, my confidence has grown in every aspect possible."</p>

                    <p>"Last month, I attended HobbyHacks hosted by TechTogether. This was my first virtual hackathon, which also happened to be my first hackathon ever. Throughout the event, I felt anxious, nervous, excited, and curious. This event was definitely an experience of a lifetime."</p>

                    <p>"As a girl interested in STEM, I’ve always felt imposter syndrome regarding careers in tech and constantly underestimated myself. However, when I attended HobbyHacks last month, I was surprised to find a safe space for all hackers — even those who were beginners, like me."</p>

                    <p>"It really is true that you get out what you put in. No matter what your skill level is, don’t feel pressured to craft your hackathon experience in a certain way. Everyone is on a different path, and your learning style will probably be different from the learning style of the next coder."</p>
