                    <p>"I’m not exaggerating when I say it seems like I learned more on the weekend of TechTogether Boston than I did in my first CS class. I built my very first Flask backend, successfully used a very complicated API with an SDK (I didn’t even know what SDK meant!), not to mention I learned a lot about finance and investment (pretty useful skills you need as an adult)."</p>
