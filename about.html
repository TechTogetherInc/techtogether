                    <p>Inclusivity in tech is not only about providing equal opportunity, but also diversity in perspective. The interdisciplinary fields of technology are among the most influential forces designing the future of humankind. If marginalized people do not have a seat at this table, the dangerous impacts will reverberate in every area of society from public health imbalance to environmental catastrophe.</p>

                    <p>TechTogether works to elevate the access, exposure, and inclusion of gender-marginalized students in the interdisciplinary fields of technology. By hosting events like hackathons, promoting inclusivity-focused research, and providing professional development resources, we strive to make dream careers more accessible to gender-marginalized communities.</p>

                    <p>As a female student of technology, founder Fiona Whittington found herself as one of the only women in the room at tech conferences and hackathons during her college years. For this reason, TechTogether (previously known as SheHacks) was founded in 2018 with the intention of ending the gender gap in technology. </p>
