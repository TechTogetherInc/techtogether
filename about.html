                    <p>TechTogether, the nation's largest initiative to address the gender inequities in the hackathon community, supports over 10,000 hackers. TechTogether is credited in part with increasing the gender diversity of the hackathon community by 18% from 2019 to 2020.</p>

                    <p>Since we were founded in 2017, TechTogether has served over 3,500 people of marginalized genders through our annual gender-focused hackathons hosted across the country. On average, 50% of our hackers have never attended a hackathon before.</p> 

                    <p>TechTogether started in 2017 as SheHacks, one of the world's largest all-female hackathons. Due to the success of SheHacks, the team created a unique model that made it easier for student groups to host similar events across the country. This model has increased the accessibility of gender-focused hackathons and tripled our initial impact.</p>

                    <p>TechTogether was the first gender-focused hackathon to adopt gender-inclusive language and policies. TechTogether has worked with other gender-focused hackathon organizations to adopt similar changes.</p>
