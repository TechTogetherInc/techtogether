                    <p>TechTogether works to elevate the access, exposure, and inclusion of gender-marginalized students in the interdisciplinary fields of technology. By hosting events like hackathons, promoting inclusivity-focused research, and providing professional development resources, we strive to make dream careers more accessible to gender-marginalized communities.</p>

                    <p>TechTogether was originally founded in 2017 as SheHacks by a group of 13 students across Boston. What was once a one-time event has transformed into a nonprofit after the founders realized the impact gender-focused events had on gender-marginalized communities.</p>

                    <p>If you want to know who is behind the success of TechTogether, look around you. The TechTogether team is now 50+ people strong and constantly growing.</p>
