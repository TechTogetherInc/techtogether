                    <p>TechTogether, the nation's largest initiative to address the gender inequities in the hackathon community, supports over 10,000 hackers. TechTogether is credited in part with increasing the representation of women and non-binary people in the hackathon community by 18% to 39% from 2019 to 2020. <a class ="blog-link" href="https://news.mlh.io/the-state-of-the-league-2020-09-08-2020">(Source: MLH 2020 State of the League Report)</a></p>

                    <p>Since we were founded in 2017, TechTogether has served over 5,600 people of marginalized genders through our annual gender-focused hackathons hosted across the country. On average, 50% of our hackers have never attended a hackathon before. TechTogether serves people of marginalized genders, this includes transgender women, cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, and all gender identities which have been systematically oppressed by those in power throughout history.</p> 

                    <p>TechTogether started in 2017 as SheHacks, the 2nd largest all-female hackathon in the world with 800 attendees. Due to the success of SheHacks, the team created a unique model that made it easier for student groups to host similar hackathons across the country. This model has increased the accessibility of gender-focused hackathons and tripled our initial impact. TechTogether currently has 6 chapters in Boston, New York, Seattle, Atlanta, Chicago, and Miami with plans to expand internationally.</p>

                    <p>TechTogether was the first gender-focused hackathon to adopt gender-inclusive language and policies. Our organization continues to advocate and work with other gender-focused hackathons to adopt similar changes.</p>
